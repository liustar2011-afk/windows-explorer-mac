# File Explorer for Mac

**The Windows 11 File Explorer, rebuilt natively for macOS.**

Same layout, same Fluent iconography, same keyboard shortcuts, driving the real macOS filesystem.

## Why

I wanted Windows Explorer on my Mac. Not "a file manager with Windows-ish styling", but the actual thing: the tab strip, the command bar, the breadcrumb address bar, `Ctrl+C` / `Ctrl+V` / `F2` / `Alt+Left`, and the Fluent icons.

So I built it. No Electron, no dependencies, no package manager. One `swiftc` invocation produces a 3 MB native app.

## Highlights

|  |  |
|---|---|
| **Pixel-faithful chrome** | Tab strip with Windows caption buttons drawn where the traffic lights normally go, breadcrumb address bar with sibling drop-downs, command bar, status bar. Colours come from the WinUI 3 dark and light palettes. |
| **Redrawn Fluent icons** | Segoe Fluent Icons isn't licensed onto macOS, so every glyph is redrawn as vector geometry on Windows' own 16pt design grid, including the two-tone accent treatment on cut, copy, paste, rename, share, sort and view. |
| **Real Windows shortcuts** | Bound to both `Ctrl` (Windows) and `Cmd` (Mac reflex), and every one of them re-mappable from Settings. |
| **Eight view modes** | Icon grids with live Quick Look thumbnails, List that flows into columns, Details with sortable resizable columns, Tiles, Content. |
| **It actually does the work** | Copy, cut and move, paste with `- Copy` conflict naming, rename, ZIP, shortcuts, Recycle Bin and permanent delete, all with undo and redo. Drag and drop works inside the app, onto sidebar folders and Quick access tiles, and to and from Finder, with the drop target lighting up as you hover it. Rubber-band selection works from any empty space, additive with `Shift` or `Ctrl`. |
| **Power tools** | Dual pane, a background transfer queue with progress, archive browsing, batch rename, folder compare and sync, a drop shelf, workspaces, network shares and user-defined commands. |

## Download

Grab the latest build from [Releases](https://github.com/gmazaratti/windows-explorer-mac/releases/latest). Universal binary, Apple Silicon and Intel, macOS 14 or newer.

The app is ad-hoc signed but **not notarized**, because notarization requires a paid Apple Developer account. macOS will therefore refuse to open it the first time. Either:

- **System Settings > Privacy & Security**, scroll down to the message about File Explorer, and click **Open Anyway**, or
- clear the quarantine flag yourself:

  ```bash
  xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/File Explorer.app"
  ```

If you would rather not do either, build it from source. That takes one command and produces a binary macOS trusts, because it never came from the internet.

## Power tools

Everything below is optional. Turn a feature off and the app is still the Explorer clone it started as.

<div align="center">
<img src="docs/dual-pane.png" width="440" alt="Dual pane with the shelf open"> <img src="docs/archive.png" width="440" alt="Browsing inside a zip archive">
</div>

**Dual pane** (`Ctrl+U`). Two independent panes, each with its own tabs and history. `Tab` switches, `Ctrl+Shift+U` swaps them, and the overflow menu copies or moves the selection straight to the other pane. Columns drop out as a pane narrows rather than overflowing it.

**Background transfers.** Copies and moves run on a queue with a progress bar in the status bar, a rate and time estimate, and a cancel button. Nothing blocks the window, and a move within one volume is still instant.

**Archive browsing.** Double-click a zip or a tarball and walk into it like a folder. Open a file inside and it is extracted to a scratch folder first. Extract the whole thing, or just the selection, from the command bar. Zip and the tar family are supported, through the system's own `bsdtar`. RAR and 7z are not, because macOS ships no tool for them.

**Batch rename** (`Ctrl+Shift+R`). Find and replace, prefix, suffix, numbering, case, extension, with a live preview and clash detection before anything is touched. It lands on the undo stack as one step.

**Folder compare and sync.** Compare two trees, see what is only on one side and what differs, then copy one way. Defaults to the two panes when they are open.

**Shelf** (`Ctrl+Shift+S`). A staging area that survives navigation: drop files in, go somewhere else, drop them out. Or use Copy here and Move here.

**Workspaces.** Save the tabs open in each pane, the split and the view mode under a name, and restore them later.

**Reopen last session.** The next launch automatically restores the windows from your last exit, including their tabs, active pane, split and window positions. Closing the last window also remembers it. Folders that no longer exist reopen at Home.

**Search.** Search recursively with plain text or filename wildcards: `*.txt`, `report*.pdf`, and `file?.csv`. Matching is case-insensitive; `*.*` includes names without extensions.


**Network shares** (`Ctrl+K`). Connect to SMB, AFP, NFS, FTP and WebDAV, with recent servers remembered. macOS owns the sign-in, so no password is ever typed into File Explorer. SFTP and S3 are not supported, because macOS cannot mount them without a third-party filesystem.

**Commands.** Your own scripts in the context menu, with the selection in the environment (`$FE_SELECTION`, `$FE_NAMES`, `$FE_FIRST`, `$FE_DIR`, `$FE_COUNT`). Managed from Settings, stored in `~/Library/Application Support/File Explorer/commands.json`. Deliberately scripts rather than loadable native code: a plugin that can crash or compromise the app is not a feature.

## Build

Requires only the Xcode Command Line Tools. No Xcode project, no Node, no Homebrew.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gmazaratti/windows-explorer-mac.git
cd windows-explorer-mac
./build.sh
open "build/File Explorer.app"
```

`./build.sh --universal` produces an Apple Silicon and Intel binary, which is what the releases ship.

To keep it around:

```bash
cp -R "build/File Explorer.app" /Applications/
```

> macOS asks permission the first time the app reads Desktop, Documents, Downloads or a removable volume. Until you allow it, those folders list as empty. That is macOS, not the app.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Every shortcut works with **`Ctrl`** (as on Windows) *and* **`Cmd`** (as Mac muscle memory expects). `Alt` means `Option`.

<table>
<tr><td valign="top">

**Clipboard and files**

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+C` | Copy |
| `Ctrl+X` | Cut |
| `Ctrl+V` | Paste |
| `Ctrl+Shift+V` | Paste shortcut |
| `Ctrl+Shift+C` | Copy as path |
| `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` | Undo, redo |
| `F2` | Rename |
| `Delete` | Recycle Bin |
| `Shift+Delete` | Delete permanently |
| `Ctrl+Shift+N` | New folder |
| `Enter` | Open |
| `Alt+Enter` | Properties |

</td><td valign="top">

**Navigation**

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Alt+Left` / `Alt+Right` | Back, forward |
| `Alt+Up` | Up one level |
| `Backspace` | Back |
| `F5` / `Ctrl+R` | Refresh |
| `Ctrl+L` / `Alt+D` / `F4` | Address bar |
| `Ctrl+F` / `F3` | Search |
| `Ctrl+D` | Show desktop (Win+D) |
| `Ctrl+Shift+D` | Go to Desktop folder |
| `Ctrl+Shift+H` | Go Home |
| `Ctrl+Shift+J` | Go to Downloads |
| Type letters | Type-ahead jump |

</td><td valign="top">

**View, tabs and windows**

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+Shift+1` to `8` | The eight view modes |
| `Ctrl+Scroll` | Cycle icon sizes |
| `Ctrl+T` / `Ctrl+W` | New tab, close tab |
| `Ctrl+Tab` | Next tab |
| `Ctrl+1` to `9` | Jump to tab |
| `Ctrl+N` | New window |
| `Ctrl+A` | Select all |
| `Alt+P` / `Alt+Shift+P` | Preview, details pane |
| `Ctrl+H` | Hidden items |
| `Ctrl+U` | Dual pane |
| `Tab` | Switch pane |
| `Ctrl+Shift+U` | Swap panes |
| `Ctrl+Shift+R` | Batch rename |
| `Ctrl+Shift+S` | Shelf |
| `Ctrl+K` | Connect to server |
| `Ctrl+,` | Settings |

</td></tr>
</table>

`Ctrl+D` is Windows' `Win+D`: it hides every app so the desktop itself is showing, and puts them back when you press it again.

## Interface language

Choose **Settings > Appearance > Language** to use the system language, English,
or Simplified Chinese. Changes apply immediately and the choice is remembered.
Chinese covers navigation, toolbars, context menus, settings, dialogs, file types,
dates and transfer status. Filenames, real paths, scripts and saved layout identifiers
are preserved. Native macOS permission messages follow the system's app language.

The interface also uses distinct toolbar/sidebar/content surfaces, restrained accent
selection, a wider navigation pane and system typography with Chinese font fallback.
Comfortable 32pt file rows remain the default; Compact view keeps 24pt rows.
Alternating row backgrounds are enabled by default in Details view. Toggle them in
Settings > Appearance > Layout or the View menu; selection and hover highlights take priority.

## System integration

Settings > Integration shows the current default folder app, lets you set File Explorer
as the default for ordinary folders, and offers Restore Finder. This changes only
`public.folder`, not document or application associations. macOS may request consent.
Apps that explicitly target Finder and native Open/Save dialogs are not replaced.

External callers can open a directory or reveal files in their containing folder:

```bash
open -a "File Explorer" "/path/to/folder"
open -a "File Explorer" "/path/to/file.txt"
```

A running app receives these requests too. Files in the same folder are selected in
one tab, and explicitly requested hidden files can be revealed without changing the
hidden-files preference. For configurable integrations, percent-encode an absolute
path in `file-explorer://open?path=…` or `file-explorer://reveal?path=…`.
The executable also accepts paths and `--reveal` (to select a folder in its parent).

## Settings

<img src="docs/settings.png" width="520" align="right" alt="Settings">

The gear at the right end of the command bar, also in the `...` menu, the background right-click menu, and on `Ctrl+,`.

- **Appearance.** System, Light or Dark, eight accent colours, and toggles for compact view, the three panes, item check boxes, extensions and hidden items.
- **Shortcuts.** Re-map any command. Click a shortcut, press the keys. If the combination is taken it is moved off the other command and you are told which. Per-command and global reset.
- **Quick access.** Everything pinned to the sidebar. Unpin any of it, including the six Windows defaults, restore what you unpinned, add folders.
- **Folder icons.** The folders you have customised, with a reset for each.

**Pinning.** Right-click any folder, in the list or the sidebar, then choose *Pin to Quick access*.

**Custom folder icons.** Right-click a folder and choose *Change icon*, then pick a Fluent glyph and a colour, or tint the standard folder. It applies in the file list, the sidebar and the Home tiles.

## How the icons were made

Windows draws its command bar with **Segoe Fluent Icons**, a font that ships with Windows and isn't available on macOS. Copying the font wasn't an option, so the glyphs are reconstructed instead.

Each icon is authored as a string in a small path language, on the same 16x16 grid Fluent uses:

```swift
.paste:  ("R 3.4 3.0 9.2 10.6 1.5 M6.2 3.0 V2.4 C6.2 1.9 6.5 1.6 7 1.6 H9 C9.5 1.6 9.8 1.9 9.8 2.4 V3.0", "")
.filter: ("M2.4 3.4 H13.6 L9.2 8.6 V13.4 L6.8 11.8 V8.6 Z", "")
```

`M/L/H/V/C/Q/Z` are the usual SVG commands, `O` adds a circle, `R` a rounded rect, `K` an arc. A parser of about 60 lines turns them into SwiftUI `Path`s rendered in a `Canvas`. A second, optional layer per icon carries the accent-coloured part: the blue rings on the scissors, the blue sheet inside the clipboard. That layer is what makes the command bar read as Windows rather than as generic line art.

The palette was taken from the WinUI 3 design tokens and cross-checked by sampling pixels out of a real Windows 11 screenshot.

  ContentView.swift    Root layout, flyout and dialog hosting
  App.swift            Window setup, key bindings, menu bar
  SelfTest.swift       End-to-end checks
Tools/
  MakeIcon.swift       Draws the app icon, one render per icon-set size
  release.sh           Signs, notarizes and staples a release build
build.sh               Compiles and assembles the .app bundle
```

Two decisions worth calling out:

- **Right-click routing.** Context-menu targets register an invisible marker view, and a window-level monitor picks the smallest target under the pointer, falling back to the file-area background. Fighting AppKit's hit-testing instead would have swallowed the left clicks SwiftUI needs for selection and drag and drop.
- **Rubber-band selection is routed the same way.** A SwiftUI drag gesture on the list background never fires, because the enclosing ScrollView claims drags for scrolling first. A window-level monitor takes the press only when it lands on empty space inside a pane, so a drag that starts on an item still drags the item.
- **Shortcuts match on key code, not character.** `Shift+3` reports `#`, not `3`, so matching on characters silently breaks every `Ctrl+Shift+<digit>` binding.

## Tests

```bash
WINEXP_SELFTEST=1 "build/File Explorer.app/Contents/MacOS/FileExplorer"
```

Creates a scratch folder and drives the **real** key handler and file operations through copy, cut, paste, undo, rename, delete, restore, navigation, tabs, view modes, type-ahead, sorting, search, shortcut re-mapping, pinning, folder icons and right-click routing. **49 checks.**

Development helpers: `WINEXP_START=<path>` opens at a folder, `WINEXP_SNAPSHOT=<file.png>` writes a screenshot of the window, `WINEXP_SIZE=1400x900` opens at a given size, `WINEXP_TEST=menu:context|dialog:settings|dialog:about|dual|dual-home|rename|archive|compare|marquee|drop` opens a particular menu, dialog or layout for inspection, and `WINEXP_DEMO=<dir>` drives the scripted tour that produces the animation at the top of this page.

## Deliberate differences

- **Extensions are shown by default.** Windows hides known ones. The toggle is in `View > Show > File name extensions`.
- **The Recycle Bin is the macOS Trash**, so deleted items land where the rest of the system expects them.
- **Drives.** The boot volume is labelled `Local Disk (C:)`, and other mounted volumes appear under This PC by their own names.
- **"Account disconnected"** reports what is actually on the Mac. It reads *iCloud Drive* or *OneDrive* when either is present, and *Account disconnected* when neither is.
- Archive browsing is read-only. Dropping files into a zip is not supported.
